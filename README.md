# CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms: Analysis & Design

## Academic Advising Assistance Program â€“ Portfolio Submission

This repository contains my final portfolio artifacts for CS-300: Data Structures and Algorithms Analysis & Design. The two pieces here represent both the analytical and practical sides of building efficient, maintainable software. The first piece is my analysis of how different data structures perform in terms of speed and memory. The second is a C++ program I built that lets academic advisors easily load, sort, and look up course information for students. Together, these show how I approach problem-solving, by evaluating my options, making design choices, and building real, efficient solutions using data structures and algorithms.
